## `hey, I'm Bill üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è`
I'm a computer science student at UofT, currently focused on developing ***Seven***, a Tetris labbing tool. I aim for the initial release to be at the end of May.
I am also working on a fun weather app where you grow a plant based on the weather, but I have to figure out how plants work first.
I enjoy studying algorithms, particularly sorting -- you can check out my Java implementation of merge/quicksort hybrid [here](https://github.com/bzyjin/fadesort/). I plan to port it to Rust to analyze and improve it further.
